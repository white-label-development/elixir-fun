## Pattern Matching. 

= is a match operator. It's not used for assignment.

##### Pattern Matching 
is where a pattern (on the lhs of the match operator) is matched (assigned?) if the values (the rhs) have the same strcuture AND each term in the pattern can be matched to a term in the values.

A literal value in the pattern matches that exact value. A variable in the pattern is matched by taking on the corresponding value.  

```
iex> a = 1
1
iex> a + 3
4
iex> a
1
```
which looks like normal, but
```
iex> 1 = a
1
iex> 2 = a
** (MatchError)
```
it's an error as this is the same as 2 = 1 which does not match. 

```[1,2,3] = [1,99,3]``` is also an MatchError

Elixir list format: ["a", "b", ["c", 4000] ]
```
iex> list = [1, 2, 3]
[1,2,3]
iex> [a, b, c] = list
[1,2,3]
iex> b
2
iex> [a, b, c] = [1, 2, 99]
[1,2,99]
```

ok, still not sure about this whole matching thing. Initially list is nothing(?) and "assigned" [1,2,3], then a new list containing three variables is created, and each variable assigned a value from list, by index. Ahhh, that's why it's not really assignment as it tries to match the rhs pattern over the left one in an assignmenty-match kind of why. "Elixir looks for a way to make the value on the lhs the same as on the rhs" = pattern matching.
The lhs can be assigned new values (c=99).

edit: in algebra x=a+1 is not assigned a+1 to x, it's saying x and a+1 have the same valie. It's a lot like that.

In the following exercise I was a bit baffled
```
iex(2)> a=[1,2,3]
[1, 2, 3]
iex(3)> a=4
4
```
in that I though a was now the pattern [1,2,3] so there would not be match for ```a=4```
I've obviously still not grasped the paradigm.
```
iex(19)> a
1
iex(20)> [1,a,3]=[1,2,3]
[1, 2, 3]
iex(21)> a
2
iex(22)>
```
I guess 2 can be assigned to 'a' because it's coming from the rhs?? We know this won't work the other way, eg:

```
iex(22)> b = 99
99
iex(23)> [1,2,3]=[1,b,3]
** (Match Error)
```

Once a variable has been bound to a value in the matching process, it keeps that value for the remainder if the match.
```
iex()>[a,a] = [1,1]
[1,1]
ies()>[b,b] = [1,2,]
** (Match Error)
```
This fails because b is assigned 1 (from [1,2] then it tries to assign 2 to the second element in the list, but this second element is b - which has aleady been set to 1.)

A variable CAN be bound to a new value in a subsequent match

```
iex(15)> a = 1
1
iex(16)> [1,a,3] = [1,2,3]
[1, 2, 3]
iex(17)> a
2
iex(18)>
```

A caret ^ prefixing a varible is called a 'pin operator' in Elixir, it is used to force retention of an existing value (can't be set). 

```
iex(22)> a = 1
1
iex(23)> a = 2
2
iex(24)> ^a = 3
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 3
```
This also works if the variable is a component of a pattern, ```[a, ^b] ```.


##### underscores are wild
```iex> [1, _, _] = [1,2,"3"]```
